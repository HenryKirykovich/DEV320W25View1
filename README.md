# DEV320W25View1

This repository is a small, static portfolio site created as a test assignment for the DEV320 course.
The goal of the assignment is to experiment with responsive layout techniques (CSS Grid and Bootstrap),
and to practice publishing a static site using GitHub and GitHub Pages.

## What this is

- Course: DEV320 (Front-end foundations / responsive layout experiments)
- Purpose: Demonstrate layout experiments using CSS Grid, Bootstrap 4, and custom CSS. This is intentionally lightweight and static.

## What's included

- `index.html` — main page (Bootstrap-based layout and project cards)
- `css/style.css` — project styles and Grid experiments
- `js/app.js` — placeholder for future JavaScript enhancements
- `data/portfolio.json` — portfolio metadata (includes `gid` fields for records)
- `html/webresources.html` — supporting web resources page
- `img/2.png` — profile image used on the page

## How to view locally

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).

Optional: serve locally with a simple HTTP server (recommended for full-features):

Windows (PowerShell):
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Notes about this repo

- This project is intended for experimentation; feel free to modify `css/style.css` and `index.html` to try Grid/Bootstrap combinations.
- `data/portfolio.json` contains small test data used to render the Projects section; it now includes unique `gid` values for records.
